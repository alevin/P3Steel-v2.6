If you have 4 LM8UU linear bearings you can use them without printed parts, just using the lasercut steel bed clamp!

----

Otherwise, you can choose between "Y bronce clamp.stl" and "Y IGUS bearing clamp.stl"

"Y clamp nut plate.stl" should be used in both cases.

In the first case you will need 4 sinterized bronce bushings:
- inner diameter= 8mm
- outer diameter= 12mm
- length= 12mm

In the second case you will need 4 IGUS RJZM-01-08 linear bearings:
- inner diameter= 8mm
- outer diameter= 16mm
- length= 25mm

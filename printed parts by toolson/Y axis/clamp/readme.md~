You can choose between "Y bronce clamp.stl" and "Y IGUS bearing clamp.stl"

In the first case you will need 4 sinterized bronce bushings:
inner diameter= 8mm
outer diameter= 12mm
length= 12mm

In the second case you will need 4 IGUS RJZM-01-08 linear bearings:
inner diameter= 8mm
outer diameter= 16mm
length= 25mm

If you have 4 LM8UU linear bearings you can use them without printedparts, just using the lasercut steel bed clamp!

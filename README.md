# P3Steel v2.6

Hi, welcome in the **P3Steel v2.6** repository. Here you can find my newly created version of the P3Steel frame. If you think it is the right frame for you, just download it and laser cut it; otherwise please tell me what would you modify in my project, I'll be very interested in your opinion!

**You can find a lot of useful information in the wiki pages: just [click here](https://github.com/iosonopersia/P3Steel-v2.6/wiki)!**

## Downloads
> P3Steel v2.6 is a modular project: see the [Blocks wiki page](https://github.com/iosonopersia/P3Steel-v2.6/wiki/Blocks) to find out more. This means that you can make your own design by yourself importing every block you need in a DXF file.

I've prepared four premade designs if you want a ready-to-cut file, so you just have to choose between one of the following links (after clicking Download, save the browser page that gets opened on your PC):

## Notice:
- The frame has to be cut from a **3mm steel** sheet. It's not possible to assemble the frame if it has not the right tickness (repetita iuvant: 3mm steel sheet!).
- All the parts of the frame in the design should be **re-positioned** by the one who will work with the laser cutter. This is why I've positioned all the parts like that (this way it's simpler to understand what should be saved and what should be discarded). Let him do that job!
- The one who works with the laser cutter probably will ask you for the **.DWG** format: you'll just have to use a program to convert .dxf into .dwg...

## Folders

### blocks
Here, divided in subfolders, you'll find all the building blocks of the frame so that it's possible to modify one independently from the others. This makes remixing this project a lot simpler than what it took to me...

### printed parts
I will collect here the set of STL files needed for the printed parts of this printer. They were made by [toolson](https://www.thingiverse.com/toolson/about). Minor parts were made by [scarou](https://www.thingiverse.com/scarou/about) and [schlotzz](https://www.thingiverse.com/schlotzz/about).

### cad
Here you will find premade designs ready-to-be-cut. Their download links are available in this page.

### img
This folder contains images and photos of the frame.

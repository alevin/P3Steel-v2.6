# P3Steel v2.6

## Warning!!!
> I haven't built this frame yet, but I've already sent the cad file to a factory which has a laser cutter: I'll can guarantee that the design is correct __*only*__ when I'll have all the pieces in my hands. If you're interested in assembling this frame, please wait some days before laser cut it.

Hi, welcome in the P3Steel v2.6 repository. Here you can find my newly created version of the P3Steel frame. If you think it is the right frame for you, just download it and laser cut it; otherwise please tell me what would you modify in my project, I'll be very interested in your opinion!

## Notice:
- The frame has to cut from a 3mm steel sheet. It's not possible to assemble the frame if it has not the right tickness (repetita iuvant: 3mm steel sheet!).
- All the parts of the frame in the design should be re-positioned by the one who will work with the laser cutter. Let him do that job!
- The one who works with the laser cutter probably will ask you the .DWG format.

## Folders
### cad
In this folder you'll find two designs, both in dxf and dwg formats. They are divided in different subfolders: one contains a version of the frame with an adaptable bed (3 or 4 fixing points), while the other has a 4 fixing points version (not adaptable to the 3 points version). If you know that you'll use 4 fixing points, is highly recommended to go for the second option: the bed will be slightly lighter and it won't be necessary to cut the "adapter" block (P3Steel_v2.6/blocks/print_bed/3_or_4_points/adapter.dxf).

### blocks
Here, divided in subfolders, you'll find all the building blocks of the frame so that it's possible to modify one independently from the others. This makes remixing this project a lot simpler than what took to me...

### img
This folder contains images and photos of the frame.

### printed_parts
I will collect here the set of STL files needed for the printed parts of this printer.

Hi, welcome in the P3Steel v2.6 repository. Here you can find my newly created version of the P3Steel frame. If you think it is the right frame for you, just download it and laser cut it; otherwise please tell me what would you modify in my project, I'll be very interested in your opinion!
# Warning!!!
> I haven't built this frame yet, but I've already sent the cad file to a factory which has a laser cutter: I'll can guarantee that the design is correct __*only*__ when I'll have all the pieces in my hands. If you're interested in assembling this frame, please wait some days before laser cut it.

## Folders
### cad
In this folder you'll find all the ready-to-be-made designs, both in dxf and dwg formats.

### blocks
Here, divided in subfolders, you'll find all the building blocks of the frame so that it's possible to modify one independently from the others.

### img
This folder contains images and photos of the frame.

### printed_parts
I will collect here the set of STL files needed for the printed parts of this printer.
